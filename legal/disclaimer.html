                        purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Reading this website, sending us an email,
                        or communicating with us through any channel does not create an attorney-client relationship.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>General Information Only</h2>
                <p>The materials on this website are intended to provide general information about Argentine law,
                    immigration procedures, and our legal services. This information is not intended to be comprehensive
                    or to address specific legal situations. Laws and regulations change frequently, and the information
                    presented may not reflect the most current legal developments.</p>

                <h2>No Legal Advice</h2>
                <p>Nothing on this website should be construed as legal advice. Legal advice can only be given after
                    consideration of the specific facts and laws applicable to your individual situation. You should

                <p>Past results described in case studies, testimonials, or elsewhere on this website do not guarantee,
                    promise, or predict similar outcomes in future matters. Each legal matter is unique and depends on
                    its own facts and circumstances. Results vary based on numerous factors including, but not limited
                    to, the specific facts of the case, applicable law, and the conduct of government agencies and
                    opposing parties.</p>

                    attorney-client relationship is established only through:</p>

                    <li>Completion of conflict-of-interest screening</li>
                    <li>Agreement on scope of representation and fees</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Confidentiality Warning</h2>
                <p>Until an attorney-client relationship is formally established, please do not send us confidential
                    information. Information submitted through this website or by email before an engagement is
                    confirmed may not be protected by attorney-client privilege.</p>
